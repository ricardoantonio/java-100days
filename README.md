# Java-100days Challenge

This repository is my personal project for the 100 days of code challenge where I'm improving my Java skills by coding and committing every day. I'm also using this project to keep track of my progress, challenges, and learning outcomes.

## Goals

The main goals of this challenge are:

- Learn and practice Java concepts and techniques
- Develop a set of useful and practical projects that showcase my Java skills
- Share my progress and experiences with other developers who are also interested in Java

## Why Java?

Based on what I've heard, Java is a popular programming language known for its strong support for object-oriented programming and strict typing. I hope that learning Java will help me solidly understand the concepts of object-oriented programming and improve my coding skills in this paradigm.

## Project Structure

Each day's project will be contained in a separate folder, named `day-XX`, where `XX` is the number of the day. In each folder, you'll find the source code and any related files for that day's project.

## Running the Projects

To run any of the projects, you'll need to have Java installed on your system. Simply navigate to the project folder and run the Java source file using your preferred method.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Any suggestions or feedback are also welcome.

## Conclusion

Thank you for visiting my Java-100days repository. I hope you find my projects and progress useful, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.

**Remember to code every day!**
